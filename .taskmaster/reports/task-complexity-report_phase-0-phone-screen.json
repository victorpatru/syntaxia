			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into: (1) Git repository initialization, (2) project folder structure creation (frontend, backend, config), (3) package.json initialization for both frontend and backend, (4) dependency installation (TanStack, Tailwind, Convex).",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard patterns and tools. Complexity is low due to well-documented steps and minimal decision points. However, clarity and reproducibility benefit from explicit subtasks for each setup phase."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure ElevenLabs Assistant",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Create assistant in ElevenLabs Dashboard, (2) configure system prompt and voice, (3) set up analysis and data collection, (4) configure knowledge base, (5) validate assistant behavior for dynamic probing and topic rotation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires domain-specific configuration, multiple settings, and validation against PRD. Complexity is moderate due to integration of several features and the need for iterative testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design Backend Schema and APIs",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define data models (users, sessions, transcripts, evaluations, question_sets), (2) design database schema, (3) implement createSession API, (4) implement endSession API, (5) implement transcript/evaluation/session APIs, (6) write unit tests for all APIs.",
			"reasoning": "Involves both schema design and multiple API implementations, each with CRUD logic and edge cases. Complexity is high due to interdependencies and the need for robust testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Routes and UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Set up routing with TanStack, (2) implement '/' route UI, (3) implement '/session' route UI, (4) implement '/summary/$id' route UI, (5) ensure mobile-first and accessibility compliance.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integration of routing, UI frameworks, and accessibility best practices. Each route has distinct UI and logic, increasing overall complexity."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Transcript Capture and Storage",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Capture real-time transcripts during sessions, (2) structure transcript data with roles and tags, (3) store transcripts in database with metadata, (4) verify transcript accuracy and storage.",

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Implement webhook/SDK event listener, (2) validate and parse evaluation payloads, (3) store evaluations with session linkage, (4) test ingestion and retrieval with mock data.",
			"reasoning": "Standard backend ingestion and persistence, but requires careful handling of external events and data validation. Complexity is moderate."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Summary Page Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement '/summary/$id' route, (2) render rubric scores and evidence, (3) display gaps and study links, (4) ensure accessibility and clarity.",
			"reasoning": "UI rendering with multiple data types and accessibility requirements. Complexity is moderate, with clear separation of concerns."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Privacy and Security Measures",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Secure storage for transcripts/evaluations, (2) implement data deletion on request, (3) display session recording notice, (4) implement rate limiting, (5) enforce session duration caps, (6) conduct security and compliance testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security, compliance, and privacy requirements. Involves cross-cutting concerns, policy enforcement, and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Testing and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Set up Jest testing framework, (2) write sample tests for frontend and backend, (3) configure GitHub Actions for CI, (4) automate deployment for both frontend and backend.",
