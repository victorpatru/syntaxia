		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Analyze Existing Codebase and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the codebase analysis into: (1) File and directory inventory, (2) Technology stack identification, (3) Architectural pattern mapping, (4) Documentation of findings.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex due to the need for systematic file discovery, technology identification, and architectural mapping. It requires both automated tooling and manual review, but follows standard patterns for codebase audits and does not involve deep refactoring or integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement JD-Conditioned Session Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) UI for JD input and selection, (2) Backend JD parsing and competency extraction, (3) Session plan generation logic, (4) Streaming SSR integration, (5) Type safety and validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to multi-layered UI/UX, backend parsing, and dynamic session generation. It requires robust data flow, type safety, and responsive design, aligning with best practices for modular frontend/backend separation and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Voice Interview Flow (A–D Sections)",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) TTS integration, (2) STT streaming setup, (3) State machine design, (4) Section transition logic, (5) Agent-driven UI sync, (6) Barge-in and interruption handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex task involving real-time voice processing, state orchestration, and agent-driven UI events. It demands expertise in asynchronous flows, error handling, and integration of multiple third-party services, with high maintainability and testability requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "On-Screen Content Rendering and Voice-Only Fallback",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) UI components for code/log/diff rendering, (2) Agent-triggered highlights/zoom, (3) Voice-only summary generation, (4) Accessibility and responsive design, (5) Fallback logic for readouts.",
			"reasoning": "Rendering complex content types and supporting voice-only fallback increases UI and logic complexity. Accessibility and responsive design add further requirements, but the patterns are well-established in modern frontend development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Rubric-Based Scoring and Feedback Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Rubric schema definition, (2) Backend scoring logic, (3) LLM prompt calibration, (4) Score/comment storage, (5) Scoring API for frontend.",
			"reasoning": "Scoring engines with deterministic LLM prompts and anchored examples require careful schema design, prompt engineering, and backend/frontend integration. Ensuring consistency and minimal variance adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Generate Transcript and Session Report",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Transcript capture and segmentation, (2) Highlight and timestamp annotation, (3) Report compilation logic, (4) Export to multiple formats, (5) Storage and retrieval in Convex.",
			"reasoning": "Generating comprehensive reports with highlights, scores, and export options involves multi-step data processing and integration. The complexity is moderate to high, but follows standard reporting and export patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Content Packs and Scenario Seeds",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Content service implementation, (2) Metadata schema design, (3) Retrieval logic by JD/domain, (4) Extensibility for future packs.",
			"reasoning": "Managing a content library with metadata and retrieval logic is moderately complex, requiring schema design and extensibility planning. The patterns are common in content management systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure Persistence and Data Models in Convex",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Data model/schema design, (2) CRUD server functions, (3) Secure access controls, (4) Secret management, (5) Privacy/PII handling.",
			"reasoning": "Defining secure, efficient data models and access controls is critical and moderately complex, especially with privacy requirements. Follows best practices for backend schema and security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Agent-Driven UI Control via Tools API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Frontend clientTools interface, (2) Backend event endpoints, (3) Idempotency and event reliability, (4) State machine integration.",
			"reasoning": "Agent-driven UI control requires robust event handling and integration with state management. Complexity is moderate to high due to the need for reliability and idempotency, but implementation patterns are established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Session Analytics and Feature Flagging (Optional MVP Scope)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Analytics service integration, (2) Feature flagging system setup, (3) Privacy and performance validation.",
			"reasoning": "Basic analytics and feature flagging are straightforward with modern SaaS tools and libraries. Complexity is moderate, mainly due to privacy and performance considerations."
