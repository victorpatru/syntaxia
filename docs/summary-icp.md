# Selling to Carol: ICP-focused Positioning (Summary)

Source: [Jason Cohen — Selling to Carol: Why targeting an ICP brings 10x more customers than you expected](https://longform.asmartbear.com/icp-ideal-customer-persona/)

## TL;DR
- Speaking to "everyone" says nothing to anyone. Anchor positioning, product, and metrics around a single Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) — "Carol."
- Clear, evocative messaging for Carol still attracts adjacent buyers ("Diana") and even some mismatches ("Eddie"), expanding effective reach rather than shrinking it.
- Ruthlessly prioritize Carol across marketing, onboarding, analytics, and roadmap; say no to off-ICP revenue that creates noise and drag.

## Core Ideas
- **Sell to someone, not everyone**: Generic messages fail in 3–10 seconds. Make trade-offs explicit so your ICP instantly recognizes fit.
- **Define "Carol"**: A real-world archetype who has the problems you solve, budget, urgency, and decision power. Capture her pains in her words.
- **Clarity scales**: Targeting Carol clarifies benefits and trade-offs, resonating with adjacent segments (often 10–100x larger cumulatively).
- **Align product and marketing**: Segment activation, usage, retention, and cancellations by ICP vs non-ICP to separate signal from noise.

## Practical Steps
- **Define ICP**: Title, company context, urgent pains, buying triggers, budget, decision flow.
- **Message for 3–10 seconds**: Visual + few words that make trade-offs obvious to Carol.
- **Instrument onboarding**: Identify Carols early via questions/behavior; segment analytics.
- **Prioritize**: Accept that off-ICP requests and deals can be expensive noise; say no.
- **Measure what matters**: Track activation, conversion, retention, cancellations, and NPS for Carols separately from others.
- **Iterate**: If Carols churn, reassess product or refine the ICP definition—not genericize.

## Examples (from the article)
- **Twilio**: Developer-first clarity won hearts (even when the buyer isn’t a developer).
- **Dollar Shave Club**: “Cheap but good” trade-off resonated broadly through clarity.
- **Subaru**: Targeted a strong niche but grew with mainstream value buyers through clear positioning (affordable, safe, rugged).

## Risks to Avoid
- **Generic positioning** that hides trade-offs.
- **Treating all feedback as equal** — noise overwhelms Carol’s signal.
- **Chasing big but off-ICP revenue** that derails roadmap and support.
