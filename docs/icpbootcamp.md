### ICP: Syntaxia — AI Phone Screen Practice (Bootcamp Grad Focus)

- **Product**: 15‑minute, voice‑first AI phone screen practice tailored to an entry‑level target JD. Output: scorecard, prioritized plan, highlights. Pay‑per‑session.
- **Core promise**: Get reps that mirror real screens so you convert projects into clear, confident answers and land first interviews faster.
- **Free trial**: First session is free for new users — 15 credits are automatically granted at signup and one session consumes 15 credits.

### Who is “Diana” (Primary ICP)

- **Title**: Bootcamp graduate / early‑career SWE (0–1 YOE), applying in 2–8 weeks.
- **Context**: Cohort job hunt; self‑taught or career‑switcher; building projects in React/Node/Python.
- **Urgent pains**:
  - Turning projects into concise business‑impact stories under time pressure.
  - Handling vague/behavioral prompts, follow‑ups, and “why” trade‑offs.
  - Unsure what “good” sounds like; anxious; lacks structured reps.
- **Buying triggers**:
  - Upcoming phone screen or recent rejection at initial screen.
  - Cohort/job‑search Slack/Discord buzz; coach/instructor referral.
  - LinkedIn DM showing “practice like the real thing” + scorecard.
- **Budget/velocity**: Price‑sensitive but impulse‑friendly; free first session lowers friction; buys 1–3 sessions same day thereafter.
- **Decision power**: Individual; wants immediate practice and clear next steps.

### Secondary Segments (Adjacent)

- **Carol (mid–senior)**: Wants fast reps for specific company/role.
- **Eddie (role‑curious)**: Testing fit for frontend/backend/full‑stack; exploring gaps.

### Clear Trade‑offs (Positioning)

- **We optimize for**: Real voice conversation, entry‑level fundamentals, JD‑specific prompts, actionable report.
- **We do not focus on**: Algorithm grind sets, long courses, human‑scheduled mocks.
- **Result**: Practical, time‑boxed reps that build interview confidence and clarity.

### Why Now

- Seasonal bootcamp graduations + cohort job hunts.
- First screens still gate interviews; voice AI now good enough for realistic, adaptive dialog.
- Low‑commitment, pay‑as‑you‑go tools fit this segment’s budget and urgency; free first session removes initial friction.

### Product Workflow (What Diana Experiences)

1. Paste an entry‑level JD (or pick templates) → parse skills/topics.
2. 15‑minute adaptive voice screen with beginner‑friendly scaffolding (light hints, rubric language).
3. Auto analysis → scorecard, prioritized plan, highlight clips.
4. First session is free via the 15 signup credits; subsequent sessions use purchased credits (15 credits per interview).

### Pricing and Unit Economics

- **First session free**: 15 credits auto‑granted on signup; one session = 15 credits.
- **After free session**:
  - **1 session**: $12.99
  - **3 sessions**: $34.99
  - **5 sessions**: $54.99
- No subscription. Packs priced for impulse purchases after experiencing value.

### Core Differentiators

- **JD‑tailored** to entry‑level signals (projects, internships, coursework).
- **Adaptive voice** with beginner‑friendly follow‑ups and “explain your trade‑off.”
- **Actionable report** grounded in fundamentals and STAR‑style behavioral framing.
- **Frictionless**: No scheduling; start now. Free first session lowers risk.

### Objections and Answers

- **“I don’t have real experience.”** We translate projects/coursework into impact stories and probe fundamentals.
- **“Will this be too advanced?”** Entry‑level tracks with scaffolding and rubric‑aligned feedback.
- **“Why not a human mock?”** Humans are great later; this delivers instant, repeatable, low‑cost reps now. Try it free.

### Activation and Onboarding

- Grant 15 credits at signup automatically; message “Your first 15‑minute session is free.”
- Ask up‑front:
  - Experience: bootcamp grad / self‑taught / career‑switcher
  - Target track: frontend/backend/full‑stack + stack (React/Node/Python)
  - JD paste or select from entry‑level templates (50+ chars min)
- Gate to credits (15 per interview); show “Start for free” CTA; post‑session offer 1/3/5 packs.

### Retention Loops

- Streaks: “3 sessions in 7 days → readiness jump.”
- Compare scorecards across target companies; prompt focused re‑practice on weakest rubric areas.
- Nudge to 3–5 packs after free session using personalized report insights.

### Success Metrics (Segmented)

- Time‑to‑first session; JD completeness rate.
- Session completion; average speaking duration; fundamentals follow‑ups handled.
- Report engagement; next‑steps clicked.
- Conversion from free → paid (1→3 pack uplift); 7‑/30‑day repurchase; NPS.

### Roadmap Priorities (ICP‑Aligned)

- Deeper fundamentals tracks (HTTP, REST, state, DB basics).
- Stronger behavioral scaffolding (STAR, trade‑offs, debugging narratives).
- Project‑to‑business translation helpers and exemplars.
- Company‑style presets for entry roles (FAANG‑style vs startup).

### What We Ignore (On Purpose)

- Full course library; non‑voice drills as primary modality.
- Enterprise/team plans until individual loop is airtight.
