### ICP: Syntaxia — AI Phone Screen Practice

- **Product**: 15‑minute, voice-first, AI phone screen practice tailored to a pasted job description. Output: scorecard, prioritized action plan, highlights. Pay‑per‑session.
- **Core promise**: Practice the exact conversation you’ll face—role‑specific, adaptive, and time‑bound—so you stop failing screens and start landing offers.

### Who is “Carol” (Primary ICP)

- **Title**: Software Engineer (mid → senior), actively interviewing or preparing within 2–6 weeks.
- **Context**: Applying to FAANG/big tech, high‑growth startups, or remote-first product companies.
- **Urgent pains**:
  - Struggles to translate real experience into crisp, conversational answers under time pressure.
  - Fails vague or open‑ended screens despite strong coding skills.
  - Wants feedback beyond “you need to communicate better.”
- **Buying triggers**:
  - Upcoming screen scheduled, or recent rejections at initial/phone screen stage.
  - Sees a JD with specific domain asks and wants to practice “that kind of interview.”
  - Referred by friends or influenced by a “practice like the real thing” demo.
- **Budget/velocity**: $12.99–$54.99 impulse-friendly; buys 1–5 sessions same day. No subscription risk.
- **Decision power**: Individual buyer; low friction; wants immediate practice.

### Secondary Segments (Adjacent, still served by Carol-first)

- **Diana (New‑grad/junior)**: Needs reps in speaking clearly and connecting projects to business impact.
- **Eddie (Mismatch/role-curious)**: Exploring transition to full‑stack, infra, or analytics; uses Syntaxia to gauge gaps.

### Clear Trade‑offs (Positioning)

- **We optimize for**: Realistic conversation, JD‑tailored prompts, time‑boxed pressure, and actionable report.
- **We do not focus on**: Endless algorithm grinding, long-form courses, or mock interviews with humans.
- **Result**: If you want structured, talk-through practice that mirrors a phone screen, we are the best option.

### Why Now

- AI voice agents are finally good enough for natural, adaptive dialog.
- Hiring pipelines still rely heavily on 15–30 min voice screens gating onsite loops.
- Engineers increasingly prefer pay‑as‑you‑go, no‑commitment study tools.

### Product Workflow (What Carol Experiences)

1. Paste JD → system parses skills/topics and generates targeted prompts.
2. 15‑minute live voice conversation with AI interviewer that adapts to answers.
3. Auto analysis → scorecard + prioritized action plan + highlights for improvement.
4. Pay per session; buy 1, 3, or 5 packs.

### Pricing and Unit Economics

- **1 session**: $12.99
- **3 sessions**: $34.99
- **5 sessions**: $54.99
- No subscription. First 15 minutes try for $1 promo is supported in marketing.
- Economics support 63–74% gross margin range at current usage assumptions.

### Core Differentiators

- **JD‑tailored**: Output questions and dialog reflect the pasted role description.
- **Adaptive voice**: Real conversation; not a static Q&A bank.
- **Actionable report**: Communication, debugging, breadth, operationalization, product sense, plus concrete next steps.
- **Frictionless**: Log in, paste JD, practice now. No scheduling.

### Objections and Answers

- **“Isn’t this just LeetCode?”** No. It trains the actual conversation and communication patterns used in phone screens.
- **“Will this feel robotic?”** Uses modern conversational AI; adjusts follow‑ups to your answers; time‑boxed like the real thing.
- **“Why not a human mock?”** Humans are great but slow and expensive. Syntaxia gives unlimited reps immediately; use humans later for final polish.

### Activation and Onboarding

- Ask two signals up-front:
  - Experience level: junior/mid/senior/staff
  - JD paste quality: enforce 50+ chars to avoid garbage inputs
- Gate to credits (15 credits per interview), surface welcome discount.
- Show sample JDs for instant autofill to “get to first success” fast.

### Retention Loops

- Immediate report creates specific practice goals; nudge to buy 3–5 pack.
- Streaks around “3 sessions in 7 days” materially move pass‑rate confidence.
- Save and compare scorecards across target roles or companies.

### Success Metrics (Segmented by ICP)

- Activation to first session time; JD completeness rate.
- Session completion rate; average speaking duration; number of follow‑ups handled.
- Report consumption: highlights viewed, next steps clicked.
- Repeat purchase rate (1→3 pack uplift); 7‑day and 30‑day repurchase.
- NPS and qualitative “felt like the real thing” feedback.

### Roadmap Priorities (ICP‑Aligned)

- Deeper JD parsing for domain tracks: web, infra, analytics, edge.
- Richer follow‑ups to probe “why” and trade-offs, not just what/how.
- Targeted improvement resources in the report (articles/videos/practice).
- Company‑style presets (FAANG vs startup) selectable at start.

### What We Ignore (On Purpose)

- Building a general interview course platform.
- Supporting non‑voice, non‑conversational drills as primary modality.
- Enterprise/team plans until individual loop is airtight.

### Messaging Guide (3–10 seconds)

- **Headline**: AI phone screen practice tailored to your job description.
- **Subhead**: Talk through a 15‑minute voice screen. Get a scorecard and prioritized plan.
- **CTA**: ./start-practicing

### Channel Hints

- Short demo video of the conversational flow.
- JD‑to‑script transformation clip; report highlights.
