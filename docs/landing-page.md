### landing page playbook

- good hero block > the rest of the landing page
- heading 1 should be clear, relatable, and interesting (avoid being too dry and too salesy)
- 3-5 min video walkthrough in hero block is always a good idea
- description of your product in hero block must be BS-free explanation of what your product is (don't repeat your tagline, explain how do you deliver the promised value)
- communicate social proof in MULTIPLE blocks (testimonials, company badges, media mentions, user stats, case studies)
- showing your product > describing your product
- have one consistent CTA (don't have a newsletter sign-up form if your goal is to get free trial leads)
- delete all animations, illustrations and other design propaganda
- write like a person (not like a virgin developer and overstimulated sales manager)
- fight the objections to not use/buy your product (don't avoid tough questions — handle them proactively)
- including pricing is not required but can be a good thing if your offer is a no-brainer
- limit every paragraph of text to 2 sentences. limit every bullet list to 5 points
- add more product visuals (screenshots and gifs)
- add more social proof (I feel like you still didn't get this)
- either don't write a founder letter or write a really good one (avoid the generic company mission with 0 unique angles)
- always have a CTA button on the screen
- highlight key things in your testimonials to make them easier to read
- most people view your landing page sitting on the toilet — make it easy to skim
- don't use buy/purchase/pay and similar words on the cta buttons ("get instant access" if the next step is to pay money)
- have a good open graph image to increase CTR
- get a free landing page structure to save time (founderpal .ai/landing-page-generator)
